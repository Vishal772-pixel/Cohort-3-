//Bitcoin whitepaper 
{*/Smart contracts are set of instructions executed in a decentralised way without any centralised or third party intermediary like banks or anyperson, any organisation , any entities 

They create trusted minimised aggrements 

Smart Contracts are 
1. Cannot be altered ( immutable ) // change nahi ho sakta
2.Automatically Executes // dont need someone to excute or operate as happen in banks ( accountant , operations , managers)
3.Everyone sees the term of agreements ( koi chota , bada nahi hota ..all have the records of agreements )
4.Transparency is unavoidable built in ( everyone is informed if something might required to change in agreements or terms in contracts )
5.Counter party risk is low and 
transparent ( as their   is no middle man ..and everyone is linked with their assets directly ..no risk and everything is transparent )
6.Interest yields are consistently high ( interest on investment is quitely high as compared to other assets)

{*/  Chainlink Decentralised Oracle Network brings external data and external computation  and give sthe features and richness that we need in a snart contract 
*/}

{*/ Hybrid Smart Contracts...that have offchain Components*/}

{*/ Layer2 or L2 solve scalability issue for blockchains like for etherum , avalanche , Solana etc */}

{*/ Decentralised app (Dapp) : this is a combination of many smart contacts */}
